# Geospatial-Accessibility-of-Public-Libraries-in-the-US

Project Summary
The modern public library began in the 19th century as a facility for storing physical materials and facilitating circulation. Since digital technology and cloud storage had not yet been developed, one of the main functions of public libraries was to satisfy the people's need for information retrieval and ingestion. Planning of Libraries in the social environment in the past were information-oriented. However, in the era of technological exploration, libraries played different roles, corresponding to shifts in people's behaviors and the evolution of society. The project investigates two perspectives on public libraries: human behavior and contemporary society. The first aspect examines how trends in public library usage have evolved over time to assess fluctuations in library visits across different years and predict the growing demand for specific library services. The second aspect involves integrating local demographic information with libraries to leverage the distribution of visitors' characteristics, enhancing library services.

Research Question

● How have the statistics on the status of public libraries in the United States evolved over time, from 2018 to 2022?

● How do public libraries integrate with the local population and leverage the distribution of visitors' characteristics to enhance services based on data from 2021 to 2022?

This is the course project for Tufts University's Spring 2024 Advanced GIS class
